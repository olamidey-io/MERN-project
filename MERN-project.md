# MERN Stack
## Step 1:
## Launch and Connect to EC2
### (a) Launch the EC2 instance

* Launch an EC2 instance: search ec2 - click launch instance - Name the instance (Ecommerce-sever) - select Amazon linux as AMI OS - instance type (t3 micro free tier) - create new key pair and download - setup security group - launch instance.

Below shows the instance in running state

### (b) Connect to the EC2 instance through ssh: 
 Once my instance started running, I connected to it from my local machine using ssh by running the command - **ssh -i "C:\Users\user\Documents\MY_PBL\MERN-ec2\MERN-ec2.pem" ec2-user@13.51.237.162**. The result is shown below

 ## **Step 2: Install node.js and MongoDB**

 ### **Reason for step 2:** 
 Step 2 is crucial because Node.js and MongoDB are fundamental components of the MERN stack, and without them, your application cannot function properly.

 ### **Installing node.js, What it does:**
 * **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It is essential for executing the backend server (Express.js) in the MERN stack. It allows JavaScript to handle requests, process data, and communicate with MongoDB.

* **npm (Node Package Manager)**, which comes with Node.js, is used to install dependencies like Express, Mongoose, and other backend packages.

Think of Node.js as the engine that powers your MERN app‚Äôs backend (server-side code). Imagine you have a car (your web application), but no engine. Without an engine (Node.js), your car cannot run. Without Node.js, your backend cannot process requests, handle user logins, or even connect to MongoDB.

### **What Node.js does in my MERN app**
Node.js is the backend engine that allows your MERN app to function. Without it, your app is just an empty shell.
* Runs JavaScript code outside the browser (on the server).
* Powers Express.js, the backend framework that handles requests (e.g., login, sign-up).
* Uses npm (Node Package Manager) to install packages (e.g., Express, Mongoose, CORS).
* Talks to MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

### **Installing MongoDB, What it does:**
* **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database used to store and manage application data.
* It allows your application to store, retrieve, and manage user data (e.g., user accounts, products, orders).
* It works well with JavaScript and JSON, making it ideal for MERN applications.

Think of MongoDB as a giant notebook where your app writes down important information (user details, product info, orders, etc.). Imagine a store with no record book. You sell products, but you don‚Äôt write down customer orders. Without MongoDB, your app forgets everything when you close it!

#### **What Node.js does in my MERN app**
* Stores user details (like name, email, passwords).
* Saves product info, orders, messages, etc.
* Sends data back to your app when requested.

### **One last Analogy**
Imagine a fast food restaurant
* **Node.js** = The chef who prepares and serves orders.
* **MongoDB** = The order book that stores all customer orders.

Without Node.js, orders can‚Äôt be processed. Likewise without MongoDB, orders are forgotten after a customer leaves. That‚Äôs why we need both Node.js and MongoDB to run the MERN stack! üöÄ

### **Node.js Installation**
  Since I am  using Amazon Linux 2023, which is based on Fedora/RHEL rather than Debian/Ubuntu. In Amazon Linux, apt is not available because it uses dnf (or yum in older versions) as the package manager.

* Next step is to first update the system using - **sudo dnf update -y**
* Then install node.js using the command **sudo dnf install -y nodejs**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-3.PNG)

* Check the version installed using **node -v** and **npm -v**
This is shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-5.PNG)

### **MongoDB Installation**
Before installing MongoDB, you first need to add the mongoDB repository. A repository (repo) in linux is like a warehouse that contains software packages that you can download and install using package managers (like dnf or yum in Amazon Linux). Think of it like an app store or playstore of linux. When you install an app on your phone, you download it from Google Play Store or Apple App Store. In Linux, when you install software, you download it from a repository (repo).

**Amazon Linux** doesnt come with MongoDB by default. If you try to install MongoDB using **dnf install mongodb**, it won‚Äôt work because Amazon Linux doesn‚Äôt know where to find it. You need to tell your system where to find MongoDB by adding MongoDB‚Äôs official repository. Once added, Amazon Linux can fetch MongoDB from this repo whenever needed.

* Create a new repository file for mongoDB - **sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-7.0.repo**

* Paste the following repo configuration inside the file, also image shown below:
#### [mongodb-org-7.0]
#### name=MongoDB Repository
#### baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2023/mongodb-org/7.0/x86_64/
#### gpgcheck=1
#### enabled=1
#### gpgkey=https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-7.0.asc

![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-4.PNG)

* Now i can install MongoDB using **sudo dnf install -y mongodb-org** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-6.PNG)

* Start MongoDB on boot - **sudo systemctl start mongod**
* Enable MongoDB on boot - **sudo systemctl enable mongod**
* Verify MongoDB is running - **sudo systemctl status mongod**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-7.PNG)

## **Step 3: Clone the remote repository**
* Since i will be using git commands here, I need to first install git before cloning. install git using **sudo yum install git** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-8.PNG)

* Then clone into my remote repository using - **git clone https://github.com/olamidey-io/MERN-project.git**

* Then change directory into the project using - **cd MERN-project**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-9.PNG)

## **Step 4: Install backend dependencies**

The package.json file is very important as it defines your project (name, version, description, author, etc.). It also tracks dependencies (express, mongodb, dotenv, etc.), so others can install them with npm install. It stores scripts (e.g., "start": "node index.js" to run your app). 

Now, when you install dependencies, another file called package-lock.json is created. It locks the exact versions of each package so that you get the same setup every time you install. This prevents issues where one developer gets a different version than another. You don‚Äôt need to manually edit package-lock.json‚Äîit‚Äôs automatically generated when you install dependencies.

#### **Imagine you are baking a cake:**
You need a recipe that lists all the ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs) and how to use them. The recipe ensures that you always use the right ingredients in the right amounts.

 In Node.js projects, package.json is your recipe. It lists all the ingredients (dependencies) your project needs. It helps Node.js install everything correctly so your backend works.

 #### **Dependencies and what they do**

 * <u>**Express**</u>: The framework that handles server requests (like a waiter in a restaurant üçΩÔ∏è).
 * <u>**Mongoose**</u>: Allows Node.js to talk to MongoDB (like a translator üìû).
 * <u>**Cors**</u>: Allows different web apps to communicate (prevents security issues üîí).
 * <u>**dotenv**</u>:Lets you store secret keys and passwords securely üîë.
 * <u>**mongodb**</u>: a node.js driver that helps you connect to the database

 ### **Final Analogy**
 * **package.json** = Recipe üìú (Lists the ingredients you need)
 * **package-lock.json** = Receipt üßæ (Ensures the exact same versions are used)
 * **Dependencies** = Ingredients ü•öüßÇ (Tools your app needs to work)
 * **npm install** = Grocery Shopping üõí (Brings all the tools into your project)

 ### **Installation**
 * First thing is to verify that package.json file is in your directory using - **ls -la**. It cannot be there as this is a new project, evidence shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-10.PNG)

* Since the file is missing, then manually add it by running **npm init -y** to create the file with some basic fields as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-11.PNG)

* And then install the dependencies using **npm install cors dotenv express mangoose mongodb** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-12.PNG).

* The content of package.json file is listed using **cat package.json** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-20.PNG)

It is also shown on a vi editor as shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-19.PNG)

## **Step 5: Setting up the .env file**
The next step is creating a **.env** file to store your MongoDB connection string securely. A **.env** file is where you store secret or environment-specific values (like database URLs, API keys, etc.) instead of hardcoding them into your code. The .env file is like a secret notepad for your project. It stores important values that your app needs to work but should NOT be shared with others. 

### **Break down of MongoDB connection string**

The connection string looks like what we have below:
**MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydatabase**

This contains three key parts which are:

*  **127.0.0.1 ‚Üí The Server Address (Localhost)**: This tells your backend where to find MongoDB. **127.0.0.1 (or localhost)** means the database is running on the same server as your backend. If MongoDB was hosted elsewhere (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), you'd use a different address. Without this? Your backend won‚Äôt know where to connect!

*  **27017 ‚Üí The Port**: A port is like a "door" or virtual communication point that allows communication between your computer and the internet. MongoDB listens for connections on port 27017 by default. When your backend wants to talk to MongoDB, it sends requests to this port. Without this? Your backend won‚Äôt reach MongoDB because it won‚Äôt know which "door" to knock on!

To check if mongoDB is running on the default port, run - **sudo netstat -tulnp | grep mongod** as shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-15.PNG)

* **mydatabase ‚Üí The Database Name**: This is the actual database where your app stores data (e.g., users, orders, etc.). If this database doesn‚Äôt exist, MongoDB will automatically create it when you insert data. Without this? Your backend wouldn't know which database to store/retrieve data from!

To get the database name, login to the mongoDB shell using **mongosh**, then **show dbs**. if no database name is listed, create a new database name using **use MERN-databse**. Then insert a sample data - **db.users.insertOne({ name: "Olamide", email: "ibrahimolamide999@gmail.com" })**. Then verify again if database name now exits by running **show dbs**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-16.PNG)

Then there is a second line in the **.env** file which is **PORT=5000**. Defines the port on which your backend (Node.js + express) will run to handle API requests. It ensures your backend runs on a specific port so that your frontend or API clients can access it. Frontend (React) Usually runs on port 3000 (serves the UI).

**The .env file is a safe place for storing secrets like:**

* **Database connection (MONGO_URI)** ‚Äì This is the address where your app can find the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. If this value is wrong or missing, your app won't be able to connect to the database, meaning users can‚Äôt save or load data.
* **API keys (API_KEY)** ‚Äì This is like a password that lets your app use external services like Google Maps, Stripe (payments), or OpenAI.
* **Ports (PORT)** ‚Äì This tells your app which "door" (port) to use for communication. Your backend listens for requests on this port. If another program is using this port, your app won't start or users won't be able to access it.
* **Authentication secrets (JWT_SECRET)** ‚Äì This is used for user authentication (logins, secure access). It helps your app know if a user is really who they say they are. If someone gets this secret, they can log in as ANY user, which is a HUGE security risk!
* **Cloud storage keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY)** ‚Äì These are keys that allow your app to store and retrieve files from cloud services like AWS S3 or Firebase. Without these keys, your app won't be able to upload images, videos, or files to the cloud.

Using a .env file protects your sensitive data and makes your app more secure and flexible. 

The **.env** file is shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-17.PNG)

## **Step 6: Modifying the server.js file and starting it**

Think of **server.js** as the brain of your backend. It is the main file that starts your **Node.js** application and connects all the parts together. **Server.js** is the main backend file that connects MongoDB, handles API requests, and starts the server.

A basic **Server.js** file should do five things:

* Import required packages (Express, Mongoose, CORS, dotenv)
* Load environment variables (from .env file)
* Connect to MongoDB
* Set up middleware (CORS, JSON parsing)
* Start the server on a specific port

Using the command - **sudo vi server.js**, i added the code to the file as shown below:

![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-18.PNG)

Then i started the server using - **node server.js**. Below is an image showing my server running and mongoDB connecteed!

![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-21.PNG)

## **Step 7: Build and Sever the React Frontend**
Now that your backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) is running, it's time to set up, build, and serve your React frontend on your EC2 instance.

Building React means converting your React code into a production-ready format that the browser can understand. Serving React means making your frontend accessible from a browser (like http://your-ec2-ip).

Now, create your frontend inside the MERN-project folder using **npx create-react-app client**. This creates a client folder and sets up a React project inside it as shown below.
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-22.PNG)

 But since npx is not installed yet, install it using - **npm install -g npx**

 Add React Import in App.js using - **vi src/App.js** and then add this line at the top of the file if missing - **import React from "react";** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-23.PNG)

Then run **npm run build**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-24.PNG)

The build was successful, but the issue now is a permission error when trying to install serve globally by running **sudo npm install -g serve** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-25.PNG)

Then serve your react app by running **serve -s build** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-26.PNG)

## **Step 8: Accessing my app on the browser**

You might not be able to directly access the app on the browser, i first need to allow port 3000 in security group. Update the security group settings. Go to AWS EC2 Console ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Your Instance ‚Üí Security Groups.
Edit Inbound Rules ‚Üí Add a new rule:
* Type: Custom TCP Rule
* Protocol: TCP
* Port Range: 3000
* Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or your specific IP for security)

#### **Restart the React Server**
First stop the running process by running **ps aux | grep serve**. finf the process PID and kill it with **kill pid**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-27.PNG)

Then restart the frontend server again using - **serve -s build -l 3000** as shown below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-28.PNG)

Then i tried accessing it on my browser with - **http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:3000** as shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-29.PNG)

## **Step 9: installing and configuring nginx as a reverse proxy**

My React app is currently being served using **serve -s build -l 3000**, but this method isn‚Äôt ideal for production because:
* The server stops when you close the terminal.
* It‚Äôs not optimized for handling traffic.

### Solution? Use Nginx as a reverse proxy!
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between your users and your actual application. Instead of users directly accessing your React app on port 3000, they access Nginx on port 80 (default HTTP port), and Nginx then forwards the request to your React app. So basically a reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of your backend (Node.js app) and frontend (React build files). It does two main things:

* Routes Requests ‚Äì It forwards client requests (from the browser) to your backend server.
* Serves the React App ‚Äì It serves your built frontend files directly.

**Benefits of using Nginx as a reverse proxy:**

* Users don‚Äôt need to type http://your-ip:3000, they can just use http://your-ip.
* Nginx improves performance with caching and load balancing.
* It adds security by hiding internal ports and configurations.

**Installing Nginx**
Exit from the client and remote repository project directory and change directory to connection to your instance, then run - **sudo yum install nginx -y** as shown below.
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-30.PNG)

Start the nginx service using - **sudo systemctl start nginx**, then enable it to start on boot using - **sudo systemctl enable nginx**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-31.PNG)

Then confirm nginx is running using - **system ctl status**
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-32.PNG)

**Configuring nginx for my MERN stack**
Since I have both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express), I will:

* Serve the React frontend from **/var/www/html/**
* Forward API requests to the Node.js backend running on a specific port.

**Create a new nginx configuration file**
Run - **sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/mern.conf** and paste the configuration inside it as shown below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-33.PNG)

To test if its actually working, i visisted my ec2 public ip on my browser to load nginx default page as seen below
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-34.PNG)

**Move my react build to my nginx root directory**

Moving my React build files to Nginx‚Äôs root directory is necessary because Nginx serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from a specified directory. If you don‚Äôt move the build folder, Nginx won't know where to find your React app, and users will see an error when trying to access the site.
My React app's production files are inside the build folder. Move them to **/var/www/html/:**
* **sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/***
* sudo cp -r ~/MERN_ec2/client/build/* /var/www/html/

But i first had this blocker below and resolve it
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-36.PNG)

Since My React app's production files are inside the build folder, i moved my react build to my nginx root folder so that nginx knows where to find my React app, then i visited my instance public ip again to access the app on my browser, but rather than loading my react front end, its still the nginx default page that is loading. I resolved that blocker with commands below:
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-37.PNG)

So below is my app being accessed on the browser
![alt text](MERN-images/Capture-35.PNG)

Since my md file is olnly apperas on my local machine and not contained in my ec2 instance yet, i can add it by doing:

* **git init**
* **git add .**
* **git commit -m "staging my changes to ec2"**
* **git remote add origin https://github.com/olamidey-io/MERN-project.git**
* **git push -u origin main**

If your remote repo and local repo doesnt match, you have to first do **git pull origin main --rebase** before **git push -u origin main**
